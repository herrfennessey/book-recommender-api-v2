# Book Recommender API V2

This codebase has been generated by [Autostrada](https://autostrada.dev/).

## Purpose

This is a go based replacement for my python book-recommender-api. One specific request would 
cause us to absolutely slam the API with 100's of requests at a time. What better way to handle
it than to put it in the big bad golang and see how it fares. 

## Usage

To run this the most easily, you can use docker-compose because we rely on a datastore emulator
to run locally.

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```
